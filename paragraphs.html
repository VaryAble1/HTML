        You have to put in many hours, especially if you have never coded before. The course description does say that no coding experience is necessary, but as with anything else, prior experience will make it easier for you. We are sure that students with no coding experience have completed the first assignment perfectly, but they probably put in a lot of work, asked questions, and after some frustrating but rewarding hours, managed to get the correct code. It is our intent that over the entire course, students should be able to get the work done in at most 15 hours a week. If, on average, you are spending lots more than that, let us know.
        We encourage research and independent learning.
